        <h1>NEVER BACK DOWN</h1>
        <P>Rap Eh 30 is my Name Okay
            You know I'll never back down, never would
            You know that team, the A-team at the top
            You know I'll never back down, never would
            For the means, the dream, the stream, and the A-team
            I came from nothing but made something I had to study
            I'd stay up late every day, wouldn't see my buddies
            At school, I was getting all-round straight A's</P>
            <P>And then I became the king of playing games
                I'm the king
                I told Dad Eh 30 what I wanna do
                He gave me one year to prove I could win on YouTube
                So I made a plan, doubled down, committed to the stream
                Became the Fortnite edit god of 2017
                You know I'll never back down, never would
                You know that team, the A-team at the top</P>
                <P>You know I'll never back down, never would
